<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    Hi everyone! So I'll be sharing a little bit about myself and this is really a challenge because I don't like talking
    about myself. I grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey I am a first generation college graduate. 
    My parents are Ecuadorian and I speak fluent English and Spanish. I am very proud of my roots and have always
     embraced where my parents are from. 
    I am part of a huge family and because of that I'm very family oriented and have like 100 cousins. 
    I love to travel and learn new languages. Lastly, I'll end my about me with my favorite quote: Change is the only constant.
